## *Synopsis*
I'm a passionate programmer with 6 years of experience in languages like Lua, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, and Python. I started my coding journey on Scratch, creating small games, and eventually moved into Roblox development with Luau. Since then, I've explored multiple languages and have grown newfound skills. Looking forward, I hope to major in computer science at MIT.
```cpp
#include <print>

int main() {
  if (a + b == c) {
    std::print("d");
  }

  return 0;
} 
```
