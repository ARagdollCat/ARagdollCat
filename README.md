## About Me
I'm a passionate programmer with 6 years of experience in languages like Lua/Luau, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, and Python. I started my coding journey on Scratch, creating small games, and eventually moved into Roblox development with Luau. Since then, I've explored multiple languages and have grown newfound skills. Looking forward, I hope to major in computer science.
